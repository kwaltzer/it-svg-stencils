These SVG stencils (IT-stencils.svg) contain graphical components that can be used as a starting point to build IT architecture drawings (i.e. from hardware to operating systems) with an "isometric" perspective.

They are built to be used and edited with Inkscape (the major opensource SVG editor). The resulting SVG file can be directly viewed inside any modern web browser, making this best suited for the usage in text-based or wiki-based documentation.

To start working on a new schema, best is to clone the SVG file, to delete its useless elements and to duplicate the remaining one before combining and/or modifying them.

== Usage of the components

Drawing a new schema can be sumed up in the following 4 stages : 

* Selection and placement of basic components ; they are the heart and soul of the schema, and represent either physical hardware components or logical infrastructure ones (ex: VM, containers, ...). By convention, logical componenents that are hosted into physical ones are represented as stacked the one over the others (See the previous exemple image with the Docker containers) ;
* Next, a badge specifying the nature of the element is placed on its side ("V" badge for virtual servers, OS badge for installed operating systems) ;
* Following, another badge specifying the function of the element is placed onto the top side (ex: reverse-proxy, ...). The two right and down border segments are used to easy its positioning ;
* At last, the relations between these elements can be drawn with the network link (uni- or bi-directional) and by security or isolation zones.

[TIP]
====
Nature on side, function on top : this is the main principle.

== Help with the placement of the components

* The file is preconfigured with a blue isometric grid that is configured so that one main graduation is equal to 4 secondary graduation, in order to easy the drawing of centers. If necessary, a second grid (yellow-orange) can be used, but needs to be activated in the document options.
** The optimal use of this grid is only attained if the grid snapping is activated. For this to work, it is necessary to ensure that the options "Snap to grids", "Snap to nodes, paths and handles" and "Snap cusp nodes, incl. rectangle corners" are activated in the "Snap controls bar" that is located by default on the right of the main screen (those options should normally be set correctly by the given file). 
* A generic box is included on the left of the file, with the 4 possible orientations for a text. Don't hesitate to copy/paste these elements to reuse them, they are here for that ! 
* At last, don't hesitate to use and abuse of the grouping functions in Inkscape to easy the management of your graphical components.

== How to ?

=== Resize elements

In order to resize an element (notably the zones and the boxes), it is required to use the path editing tool (F2), as Inkscape and more generally SVG don't include "control nodes" as in MS Visio.

For a box :

For a zone :

=== Edit network links

In addition to resizing them, it can be useful to add or remove bends into the network links.

In order to add a new bend, we use the path editing tool (F2) again to add new control nodes (Ctrl + clic) :

To delete a bend, don't forget to select the new resulting segment and to use the toolbar button "Make selected segments lines" for it to be straight and not curved :

=== Edit text

Editing text is done with the text tool (T). In order to respect the isometric perspective, it is advised to start any new text area by duplicating one of the 4 example text area :

=== Create a new "function" badge

Creating a new badge to stick on the top of a box from an existing vector logo (ex: existing SVG file) is done by using the rotate and skew tools :

Some examples are already in the reference file.

== Some graphic rules

It is of course possible to modify the given stencils, but, in order to obtain a more aesthetic look, it is advised to comply with the following rules : 

* Concerning physical and logical elements :
** Their stroke is black (#000000ff), with a 1px width, a round join and a round cap ;
** Every visible face of an isometric box should have the same T, S and A color components ; L must be :
*** 204 for the top face,
*** 230 for the lateral (right) face,
*** 242 for the front (left) face.
* Concerning zones :
** Their stroke have a 1px width, with a round join and a round cap. The rectangle border is round, with one main grid graduation (10px) radius ;
** Every zone and their label use only 2 colors that share the same T, S and A color components ; L must be 213 for the light color and 64 for the dark one ;
* The font used is a sans-serif font.
